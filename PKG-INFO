Description: 

        Welcome to ShellLogger's documentation!
        ***************************************************

        ShellLogger captures all user interactions with a shell. 
        It is intended to be used for software engineering researchers
        who are interested in inferring programmer behavior from data
        that can be captured automatically during a programming session.
        It is similar to the Unix 'script' program, but provides
        additional features such as XML output, distinguishing user input
        from system output and tracking the user's current directory.
